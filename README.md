# dashtrans - English translations for the APEX dashboard competition

There is currently a competition to build a dashboard in Oracle Application Express. The supplied data is in German, so this projects aims to update fields to be in English (to hopefully make it easier to work with). The translations were just done with Google translate 1-1, so may not be the best. Feel free to update any of the CSV files to act accordingly.

To apply the updates, run:

```
sql dash_comp/dash_comp@//192.168.1.15/xe @to_en
```

Substituting your database connection details where necessary.

to_do: reverse the updates back to German
